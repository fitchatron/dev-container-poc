# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

# define the services/containers to be run
services:
  # define the frontend service
  # we can use any name for the service. A standard naming convention is to use "web" for the frontend
  web:
    # we use depends_on to specify that service depends on another service
    # in this case, we specify that the web depends on the api service
    # this means that the api service will be started before the web service
    depends_on:
      - api
    # specify the build context for the web service
    # this is the directory where the Dockerfile for the web service is located
